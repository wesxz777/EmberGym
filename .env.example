# Environment Variables (Optional)

## Frontend Environment Variables

You can override the default API URL by creating a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# For local development (default)
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api

# For production (after deploying to Railway)
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api
```

## How It Works

The frontend automatically determines which API URL to use:

1. **Local Development**: Uses `http://localhost:3001/api`
2. **Production (GitHub Pages)**: 
   - Uses `VITE_API_URL` if set
   - Otherwise uses the default URL configured in `src/config/api.ts`

## After Railway Deployment

1. Deploy your backend to Railway (see `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`)
2. Get your Railway backend URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
3. Update `src/config/api.ts` with your Railway URL:
   ```typescript
   return 'https://your-app.railway.app/api';
   ```
4. Commit and push to GitHub
5. GitHub Pages will rebuild with the new API URL

## Note

- `.env` files are gitignored and won't be deployed to GitHub Pages
- For GitHub Pages deployment, you must update the code directly in `src/config/api.ts`
- For local testing with a different API, use `.env` file
